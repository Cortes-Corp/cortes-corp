            Gully is a hands on, experienced realtor. She was reliable with all
            my affairs while selling my house in Hempstead, LI. When a challenge
            came up, she proactively provided me with the resources I needed to
            resolve the issue. I recommend her to new buyers and sellers for her
            patience and care; as well as seasoned investors with her
            efficiencies.
